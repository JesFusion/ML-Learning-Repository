Part 2: Your Git Lesson (Module 2.4: Writing Good Commit Messages)
(This is the lesson part. You'll apply this to your 02_employee_analysis.py file in Part 3).

This is a "soft skill" that will immediately make you look like a professional. When an ML hiring manager looks at your GitHub, this is one of the first things they see.

Why do good commit messages matter? Your commit history is a story. When you run git log, it's like reading the chapter titles of your project.

Bad history: "code", "fixed stuff", "lol", "one more try"

Good history: "Fix: Prevent crash when user inputs zero", "Feat: Add user authentication with JWT", "Docs: Update README with setup instructions"

A good history tells you why the code changed, making it 100x easier to find bugs or understand a project six months later.

Here are the two golden rules:

Rule 1: The Imperative Mood

What it means: Write your commit message like you're giving a command or an instruction.

Analogy: Think of a commit as a patch or a set of instructions to apply to the code. Your message is the title of that instruction set.

This patch will... "Fix login bug"

This patch will... "Add groupby analysis"

This patch will... "Update employee data"

The Test: Your commit message should complete this sentence: "If applied, this commit will..."

Examples:

YES: Fix: Correct the mean salary calculation

YES: Feat: Add new employee analysis script

NO: Fixed the calculation

NO: Added a new script

Rule 2: The "50/72" Rule (The Format) This rule governs the length of your commit message for maximum readability in terminals.

The Subject Line (The 50):

Keep your subject line (the part after -m "...") under 50 characters.

This is because git log --oneline cuts off after ~50 characters. You want your entire message to be visible.

It should be a short summary.

(Pro-tip: Many pros start this with a "type" tag like Feat:, Fix:, Docs:, Style:, Refactor:)

The Body (The 72):

If your change is too complex for 50 characters, you can add a body.

To do this, just type git commit (with no -m). This will open a terminal text editor (like Vim or Nano).

You write your < 50 char subject>, then leave a blank line, then write a more detailed explanation, making sure to wrap each line at 72 characters.

For now, just stick to the -m "..." and the 50-character rule. It's all you need.

Bad Commit Message: git commit -m "wrote some code for the new assignment and also i used groupby" (Too long, not imperative, vague)

Good Commit Message: git commit -m "Feat: Add employee analysis script with groupby" (Imperative, <50 chars, clear, has a "type" tag)
