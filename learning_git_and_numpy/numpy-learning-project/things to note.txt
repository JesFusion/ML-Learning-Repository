    "Here are the legacy methods for creating random NumPy arrays using the np.random. notation:"

    np.random.rand(d0, d1, ...): generates an array of random floats from a uniform distribution over [0, 1), taking dimensions as separate arguments.
    float_array = np.random.rand(3, 2)


    np.random.random(size) generates an array of random floats from a uniform distribution over [0.0, 1.0), taking the shape as a tuple or int.
    float_array_2 = np.random.random(size=(3, 2))


    np.random.randn(d0, d1, ...) generates an array of random floats from a standard normal distribution (mean 0, stdev 1), taking dimensions as separate arguments.
    normal_array = np.random.randn(3, 3)


    np.random.randint(low, high, size) generates an array of random integers from low (inclusive) to high (exclusive).
    int_array = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(1, 5))


    np.random.normal(loc, scale, size) generates an array of random floats from a normal distribution with specified mean (loc) and standard deviation (scale).
    normal_array_2 = np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=(3, 3))


    np.random.uniform(low, high, size) generates an array of random floats from a uniform distribution within a specified range [low, high).
    uniform_array = np.random.uniform(5.0, 10.0, size=(2, 2))

    
    np.random.choice(a, size) generates a random sample from a given 1-D array or sequence a.
    sample_array = np.random.choice(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], size=3)

{
    "Text Styling:"

    - Bold: **text** or __text__

    - Italic: *text* or _text_
    
    - Strikethrough: ~~text~~

    - Bold and Italic (nested): **_text_** or ***text***

    - Subscript: <sub>text</sub> (using inline HTML)

    - Superscript: <sup>text</sup> (using inline HTML)
    
    - Underline: <ins>text</ins> (using inline HTML) 
    
    
    "Headings and Structure:"
    - Headings: Use # symbols (H1 to H6)
    # Heading 1
    ## Heading 2
    
    - Paragraphs: Separate text with a blank line.
    
    - Line Breaks: In an .md file, use two trailing spaces or a backslash at the end of a line, or a blank line for a new paragraph.

    - Horizontal Rule: Three or more hyphens (---), asterisks (***), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.


    "Lists:"
    - Unordered List: Start a line with *, -, or +.

    - Ordered List: Start a line with a number followed by a period (e.g., 1.).

    - Nested Lists: Indent list items with spaces (typically 2 or 4, depending on context).

    - Task Lists (GFM extension): Add checkboxes to list items.
    - [x] Completed task
    - [ ] Incomplete task


    "Links and Images:"
    - Links: [Link text](URL) or automatic linking for raw URLs (<http://example.com>).
    
    - Images: ![Alt text](Image URL).

    - Relative Links: Links to other files within the same repository automatically work. 

    
    "Code and Quoting:"
    - Inline Code: Enclose text in single backticks (`code`).
    
    - Fenced Code Blocks: Enclose blocks of code in triple backticks (```).

    - Syntax highlighting is supported by specifying the language after the opening backticks:
    ```python.
    Blockquotes: Preface text with >.
    > Quoted text
    ```

{
    There are 3 simple BroadCasting rules. NumPy compares the shapes of your two arrays (e.g., A and B) from right to left.

    - Rule 1: Align shapes from the right.

    A: (4, 3, 2)

    B: ( , 3, 2) (If B's shape is (3, 2))

    A: (4, 3, 2)

    B: ( , 2) (If B's shape is (2,))

    
    
    
    - Rule 2: Check if dimensions are compatible.

    Starting from the right, each pair of dimensions must be compatible. A pair is "compatible" if:

    The dimensions are equal (e.g., 2 vs 2), OR

    One of the dimensions is 1.

    
    
    
    - Rule 3: "Stretch" (broadcast) the dimension of size 1.

    If a pair is compatible because one of them is 1, NumPy "stretches" that 1 to match the other dimension.




    `Examples:`
    - Example 1: Success (The "Paint Roller") A (3, 3) + B (3, 1)

    Align: A: (3, 3) B: (3, 1)

    Check (Right-to-Left):

    3 vs 1: Compatible! (Rule 2)

    3 vs 3: Compatible! (Rule 2)

    Stretch:

    NumPy stretches B's shape from (3, 1) to (3, 3).

    Result: SUCCESS! (This is our "smart paint roller" from last lesson).

    

    
    - Example 2: Success (The "Row Vector") A (3, 3) + B (3,)

    Align: A: (3, 3) B: ( , 3)

    Check (Right-to-Left):

    3 vs 3: Compatible! (Rule 2)

    3 vs (empty): Compatible! (NumPy treats "empty" as 1. This is Rule 2).

    Stretch:

    NumPy first promotes B's shape to (1, 3).

    It then stretches this (1, 3) shape to (3, 3).

    Result: SUCCESS! (This is our "row vector" add from last lesson).

    
    
    
    
    - Example 3: FAILURE (The "Why it breaks") A (3, 4) + B (3,)

    Align: A: (3, 4) B: ( , 3)

    Check (Right-to-Left):

    4 vs 3: INCOMPATIBLE! (They are not equal, and neither is 1).

    Result: ERROR! ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (3,4) (3,)

    samples = rows

    features = columns
},

{
    NEVER, EVER, EVER use "git reset --hard" on a branch that you have pushed and shared with a team (like main). If you do, you're "burning" pages that your teammates might have!
},


{
    NEVER rebase a public branch (like main). Only rebase your own local feature branches before you push them. Rewriting public history breaks everyone else's work.

    Git LFS (Large File Storage)

    Git LFS is an extension that tricks Git.

    When you git add huge_model.pt, LFS steps in.

    It takes the actual 200MB file and uploads it to a separate, specialized server.

    It replaces the file in your Git repo with a tiny pointer file (text) that says: "The real file is over there at this address."

    Git tracks the tiny pointer (fast/small). LFS manages the big blob.

    The Workflow (One-Time Setup per Repo):

    Install (Once per computer): git lfs install

    Track (Once per file type): Tell LFS which files to handle.

    git lfs track "*.h5" (Tracks all HDF5 model files)

    git lfs track "*.csv" (Tracks all CSVs)

    This creates a .gitattributes file (like .gitignore).

    Commit & Push:

    git add .gitattributes (Commit the tracking config)

    git add my_huge_model.h5

    git commit -m "Add model"

    git push (LFS handles the upload automatically).
