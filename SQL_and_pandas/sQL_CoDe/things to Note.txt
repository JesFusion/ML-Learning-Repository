{
    The Best Practice (This is the rule you should follow) Your code is read 10x more than it is written. The goal of formatting is readability.

    RULE 1: SQL Keywords are UPPERCASE

    This includes SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, AS, LIMIT, JOIN, ON.

    RULE 2: Your Identifiers are lowercase or snake_case

    This includes your table names (employees, sales) and your column names (first_name, salary).
},

{
    The WHERE clause comes after FROM but before GROUP BY or ORDER BY.

    Comparison Operators: These are the standard math operators.

    = (Equal to)

    != or <> (Not equal to)

    > (Greater than)

    < (Less than)

    >= (Greater than or equal to)

    <= (Less than or equal to)
}
