    How to use "if_exists" parameter in pd.read_sql():
    
    if_exists: What to do if the table already exists?

    - 'fail' (Default): Stop and give an error. Safe, but annoying.

    - 'replace': Drop the old table and create a new one. Good for "refreshing" a daily report.

    - 'append': Add your new rows to the bottom of the old table. Good for "logging" data over time.

    nominal Data: Data that has no order/rank (e.g: East, West, North, South)

    ordinal Data: Data that has order/rank (e.g: Big, Medium, Small)
},

{
    the .replace() method is used to remove unwanted characters from object datatypes in python. For Example:
    "To remove the "$" and "," symbol from the values in a prices column (and convert to numbers), use:"

    df['prices'] = df['prices'].replace('[\$,]', '', regex=True).astype(float)

    Explanation:

    1. `df['prices']`  
    Accesses the `prices` column in your DataFrame.

    2. `.replace('[\,]', ”, regex=True)`  
    - This uses a regular expression (regex) to remove unwanted characters.
    - `[$,]` means: match any `` or `,`.
        - `$` → matches a literal dollar sign (``)
        - `,` → matches a comma
    - `”` → replaces the matched characters with nothing (i.e. removes them)
    - `regex=True` tells Pandas to treat the pattern as a regex.

    3. `.astype(float)`  
    Converts the cleaned string values into actual floating-point numbers.
